# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using AI techniques and clinical features. The objective is to develop an accurate predictive model for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.

## Project Overview

The project leverages AI techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on clinical features. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and treatment plans.

## Objective

The main objectives of the project are:

- Preprocess and analyze clinical data to enhance quality and standardize features.
- Develop machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict breast cancer.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and compare their performance.
- Visualize results and provide insights for interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- Python and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- NumPy for numerical operations.

## Data Preprocessing

- Analyze and clean clinical data.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Standardize and normalize features as necessary.
